The solution involved a more thorough process check, going beyond simply identifying port conflicts. Using tools like `lsof -i :19000` (or the equivalent for your system and desired port) to check which process actually owns the port, and then analyzing system logs for deeper clues into the error. In this example, it showed a zombie process was still lingering and holding the port.  After forcibly terminating that process, and then restarting the Expo CLI, the development server started successfully.  This highlights the importance of detailed process inspection when encountering vague port conflict errors. This comprehensive approach solves the issue and provides a robust solution for future occurrences.
