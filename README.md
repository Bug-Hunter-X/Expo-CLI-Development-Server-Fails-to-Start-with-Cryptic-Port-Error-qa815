This repository demonstrates a problem encountered with the Expo CLI, where the development server fails to start due to a cryptic port conflict error.  The standard troubleshooting steps did not resolve the issue. The `expoBug.js` file contains example code demonstrating a typical setup, while `expoBugSolution.js` offers a solution, focusing on a more detailed inspection of processes and system logs. This provides a clear understanding of the bug, its context, and a reliable solution.
